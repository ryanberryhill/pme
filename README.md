pme - Proof Minimize and Explain
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ryanberryhill/pme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ryanberryhill/pme)

This is a library and utility to minimize and explain safe inductive invariants
for hardware. Safe inductive invariants are proofs of safety generated by
algorithms like IC3.

The current version only checks if a proof is a safe inductive invariant.

Building pme
------------

To build pme you will need a C++11 compiler. The unit tests also depend on the
boost unit test framework.


    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check   # optional, requires boost
    $ make install # optional
