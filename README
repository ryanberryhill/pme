pme - Proof Minimize and Explain
---

This is a library and utility to minimize and explain safe inductive invariants
for hardware. Safe inductive invariants are proofs of safety generated by
algorithms like IC3.

The current version only checks if a proof is a safe inductive invariant.

Building pme
---

To build pme you will need a C++11 compiler. The unit tests also depend on the
boost unit test framework.

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install # optional
